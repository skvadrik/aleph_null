<p>Hi friends,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just want to explain what happened and why I left so suddenly.</p>
<p>I was upset by the recent management decision to increase our developer productivity by physically separating our seating places. We have never been told that our interaction is a problem, and I’m sure it wasn’t. I talked to the management a couple of times, but I couldn’t make them hear. At last, I decided to put my job at risk to show them how important it was. Alas, they heard me<code>...</code> but not exactly the way I wanted. :D</p>
<p>I don’t think one can <em>force</em> people into doing their jobs better; nor do I think it is good to conceal information from people. I strongly believe in relationships built on trust and respect. Managers trust developers, and in return developers take personal responsibility for their projects. That being said, it is way too easy to underestimate what it takes to be a manager, especially from developer’s standpoint.</p>
<p>But enough of this whining, and on to the main idea of this post!</p>
<p>I really want to say how much I like you people, and how grateful I am for all the good things you did. I got more than I’ve given, and in many respects I want to be more like you. Some of you are too modest to think I mean <em>you</em> personally, but nevertheless. I learned a lot about algorithms, architectures, build systems, compilers, debug, git, graph theory, libraries, linkers, linux, make, multithreading, translation, and even a bit about programming in C++ (despite all my efforts to rewrite it in pure C!). I never met a group of people so truly in love with C++. Working in this company was like constant fun.</p>
<p>With that<code>...</code></p>

<p>I’m not saying goodbye – see you in the open source world. :)</p>
